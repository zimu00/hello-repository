how to express newline in windows c

how many files to be stored ?
didn't initialize the filename pointer

ERROR_BAD_UNIT
20 (0x14)
The system cannot find the device specified.
before the total has this error,cz in createfile should have both file_share_read and file_share_write

record_th.filename[record_th.count]=filetmp;this won't work properly cz this gives address of filetmp to it,once
the content of filetmp changes,the content of record_th.filename[record_th.count] will also change,so filetmp also
needs to use an array pointer
cz don't know how to pass string to LPTSTR,so i used one more TCHAR filet,then pass it to filetmp[tmp_c],then pass filetmp[tmp_c] to record
don't forget to clean result every time
but still no working,so just changed LPTSTR into TCHAR
