typedef struct messages{
}Message,*LPMESSAGE;
sizeof(LPMESSAGE) 4
sizeof(Message) 104


i got into a deadlock
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7123755/vc-2010-weird-critical-section-error
can debug finding q is not initialized in dequeue()
q=(LPQUEUE)calloc(1,sizeof(Queue)); should not be sizeof(LPQUEUE)
found in consumer side forget to add this when create consumer threads,so of course empty
thread[i].q = products;

the customer and producer need to be waited separately cz otw once consumer finishes,producer goes on producing but no consumer
consumes,then will keep on waiting,same idea with producer finishes first

before can't run then find when debug several times one line by one line in the begining,it can work
