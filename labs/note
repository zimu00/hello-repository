3.2 before the variables in storage_type are always recognized as id:
--->forget to add {},so it can only look for id.Remember,the cup works in this way:
it works from bottom to top,so first shift all terminals  till can reduce,so if terminal
symbols are not right,it must be the reason of the scanner

3.2 can't show LEN_TYPE
--->cz in both LEN_TYPE and DECLARE_TYPE have long type,and write DECLARE_TYPE in the front of
LEN_TYPE,so of course every time it will recognize as DECLARE_TYPE

7.1 take care of the type declared,e.g non terminal Expr id,then
id ::= ID:x {: RESULT=new Expr(x); :}
without using right type,can also not use the functions defined in the class

at first the id value is always NULL,the reason is that in jflex,I didn't pass the value:
{ID} { return symbol(sym.ID, new String(yytext()));}

has nullpointer error cz in init i used HashMap<...> declare again(has already declared
in parser code) so of course null

before the result is always NULL cz the key should be the first para of put()
